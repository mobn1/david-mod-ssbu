# Integration Testing Instructions

Once you have received the Super Smash Bros Ultimate build and the ARCropolis mod, follow these steps to test the David mod integration:

1. Install ARCropolis mod on your Super Smash Bros Ultimate setup.
2. Copy the compiled `david_mod.nro` file to the appropriate mods directory as specified by ARCropolis documentation.
3. Launch Super Smash Bros Ultimate with ARCropolis enabled.
4. In the character select screen, choose Mario (which should now be replaced by David).
5. Start a match and test the following:
   - Basic movements and attacks
   - Special moves (Neutral, Side, Up, and Down specials)
   - Sandevistan activation and its effects
   - Chrome Overload and its impact on David's performance
6. Check for any visual glitches or unexpected behaviors.
7. Test interactions with other characters and stage elements.
8. Verify that the HUD displays the Sandevistan Gauge and Chrome Balance correctly.

If you encounter any issues or unexpected behaviors, please document them in detail, including:
- The specific action or situation that caused the issue
- Any error messages or visual artifacts
- Steps to reproduce the problem

After testing, provide feedback on the following aspects:
- Overall integration stability
- Performance impact, if any
- Feel and balance of David's moves and mechanics
- Any suggestions for improvements or additional features

This feedback will be crucial for refining the mod and ensuring a seamless integration with Super Smash Bros Ultimate.
